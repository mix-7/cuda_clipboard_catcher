Clipboard Catcher - plugin for CudaText.
Plugin is intended to automatically insert clipboard contents into the
same document, when new content appears in the clipboard.

To activate the plugin, call menu item "Plugins / Clipboard Catcher Toggle".
After you do it, plugin must show blue rectangle in the statusbar.
After that, you can copy fragments to clipboard.
Plugin will auto-insert text into the same document, the document which was
focused on activation. If you close the UI-tab of this document, plugin
will be auto-deactivated.

Clipboard contents is inserted after the caret, or over the selected text.
You can 'copy' from different programs, different CudaText UI-tabs, or from
the same UI-tab if it is "splitted" (CudaText menu "View / Split tab").
